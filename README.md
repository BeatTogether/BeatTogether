## Features
* Private server free from Beat Saber official; allowing Quest to play freely on modded installs
* Crossplay between all compatible platforms
* Custom songs between platforms

## Installation

To install, Download the latest mod from our releases. [Click Here](https://github.com/pythonology/BeatTogether/releases)

Extract the zip file to your Beat Saber game directory (the one `Beat Saber.exe` is in).
* The `MultiplayerExtensions.dll` (and `MultiplayerExtensions.pdb` if it exists) should end up in your `Plugins` folder (**NOT** the one in `Beat Saber_Data`).

## Custom Song Support

**To play a custom song with a Quest user, they must manually install the custom map prior to a session. Be sure to alert them of this before starting a game.**

For PC players, doing customs is simple! Just go to the install instructions for the MultiplayerExtensions plugin and put it inside your Beat Saber Plugins folder. You can view these instructions by clicking [here](https://github.com/Zingabopp/MultiplayerExtensions#installation).
